  <p>Insert a company's current assets and current liabilities and this calculator will caluclate the working capital <br>
  What is working capital?<br>
  Also known as net working capital (NWC), the working capital is the difference between a company's current assets such as cash and it's current liabilities such as debts. It's used to gauge the short-term health of a company.<br></p>
  How to calculate the working capital?<br>
  To calculate the working capital subtract a company's current liabilities from it's current assets. <br>
  working capital = current assets - current liabilities <br>
  Working capital is ofthen stated as a dollar figure. <br>
  Example A company has $120,000 of current assets and $40,000 of current liabilities calculate the working capital? <br>
  working capital = current assets - current liabilities <br>
  working capital = $120,000 - $40,000 <br>
  working capital = $80,000 <br>
  and there fore the company has $80,000 to use in the short term for a specific reason. <br>
  when a working capital is positive, this means the company's current assets are greater thant it's current liabilities and the company has enough cash to cover it's short term debt. <br>
  When a working capital is negative, this means the company's current liabilites are greater than it's current assets and the company doesn't has enough cash to cover it's short term debt. Negative working capital indicates a low liquidity and poor short term finincial health. <br>
  Why use the working capital? <br>
  Working capital effects your business in many ways, from paying your employees and vendors to planning for sustainable long term growth.
